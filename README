AVRQueue
========

AVRQueue is a task queuing library for AVR and Arduino processors.  Included here are two different branches, **AVR** and **Arduino**.

This is a simple queuing library.  Add functions to the queue, along with a unique identifier, an initial run time, and a recurrence time.  If your time scale is in seconds, an item with an initial run time of 1, and a recurrence of 5 will run after time 1 second, and every 5 seconds thereafter.

Functions are not guaranteed to execute deterministic when they're scheduled.  This is a very primitive library.  The run function simply waits for a function in the queue to reach its run time, runs the function, then continues through the queue.  If queued functions take a very long time to execute, then functions may not execute precisely when desired.  For this reason, a "now" variable is passed into every function in order to let it know when it actually runs.

AVR
---

The AVR library is oriented towards enthusiasts.  Compile **queue.c** with your project, and include **queue.h** in any files that need to add, modify, remove, or execute functions from the queue.

All settings are in **queue.h**:

* ***QUEUE_DEPTH***:  The number of functions that you can store in the queue.  More functions = more RAM required. (_Default:_ 10)

* ***NAME_LIMIT***: The number of characters used to store unique IDs for tasks. (_Default:_ 8)

* ***queue_time_t***: Typedef for the storage of timing data.  Use the native type for whatever time system you're using. (If you're using AVR timers, change this to uint_16t). (_Default:_ uint_32t)

### Usage

* ***Queued Functions***: All queued functions must have the following C signature:
> int queued\_function(queue\_time\_t now)<br />
> The _now_ variable will contain the time the function was called.

* int scheduleFunction(queuedFunction **pFunction**, const char ***pId**, queue\_time\_t **pInitialRun**, queue\_time\_t **pRecur**)
> Add a function to the queue.<br/>
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **0** if successful.<br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful (queue is full).<br/>

 * **pFunction**: Function to put in the queue.
 * ***pId**: Up to 8 character unique identifier. (Unless you change the length).
 * **pInitialRun**: Initial run time, in whatever time units you feed into **run**.
 * **pRecur**: Recurrence period, in whatever time units you feed into **run**.

* int scheduleRemoveFunction(const char ***pId**)
> Remove a function with given unique ID from the queue.<br />
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **0** if successful. <br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful.

 * ***pId**: Unique id 

* int scheduleChangeFunction(const char ***pId**, queue_time_t **pNewNext**, queue_time_t **pNewRecur**)
> Change function in the queue.<br/>
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **0** if successful. <br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful.

 * ***pId**: Unique identifier.
 * **pNewNext**: Next time to run the function.
 * **pNewRecur**: New recurrence time.

* int scheduleRun(queue_time_t **pNow**)
> Run all the queued items.  Run this in a loop to execute the queue.<br/>
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful.
>> **Number of queue items successfully ran** otherwise.

 * **pNow**: the current time.

Arduino
-------

The Arduino library is much easier to use.  Extract to <Arduino Root>/Libraries/Queue/, restart the IDE, and start using.

* Maximum of 10 items in the queue.
* Unique IDs are up to 8 characters, no more.
* Use with ```millis();```

### Usage

* ***Queued Functions***: All queued functions must have a C signature (either not class-members, or static class-members) of:
> int queued\_function(unsigned long now)<br />
> The _now_ variable will contain the time the function was called.

* ***Creating a Queue***: Create a queue like this: ```Queue myQueue;```

* int Queue::scheduleFunction(queuedFunction **pFunction**, const char ***pId**, unsigned long **pInitialRun**, unsigned long **pRecur**)
> Add a function to the queue.<br/>
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **0** if successful.<br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful (queue is full).<br/>

 * **pFunction**: Function to put in the queue.
 * ***pId**: Up to 8 character unique identifier. (Unless you change the length).
 * **pInitialRun**: Initial run time, in milliseconds.
 * **pRecur**: Recurrence period, in milliseconds.

* int Queue::scheduleRemoveFunction(const char ***pId**)
> Remove a function with given unique ID from the queue.<br />
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **0** if successful. <br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful.

 * ***pId**: Unique id 

* int Queue::scheduleChangeFunction(const char ***pId**, unsigned long **pNewNext**, unsigned long **pNewRecur**)
> Change function in the queue.<br/>
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **0** if successful. <br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful.

 * ***pId**: Unique identifier.
 * **pNewNext**: Next time to run the function.
 * **pNewRecur**: New recurrence time.

* int Queue::scheduleRun(unsigned long **pNow**)
> Run all the queued items.  Run this in a loop to execute the queue.<br/>
> ***Return Values:***<br/>
>> **-1** if unsuccessful.
>> **Number of queue items successfully ran** otherwise.

 * **pNow**: the current time, in Milliseconds.
